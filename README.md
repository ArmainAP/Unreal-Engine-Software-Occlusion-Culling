# Unreal-Engine-Software-Occlusion-Culling
This plugin is reintroducing the functionality of CPU-based occlusion culling after its removal from the Unreal Engine 5.

## Features
* **Standalone**: Not embedded in the core rendering pipeline, enabling customization and extension across all projects.
* **Legacy**: UE4 system stats and settings remain accessible for debugging and profiling.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Copy the plugin to your Unreal Engine project's `Plugins` directory. If you donâ€™t have one, create it.
3. Restart the Unreal Engine Editor.
4. Enable the `SoftwareOcclusionCulling` plugin via the Plugin Manager.

## Usage
1. You can adjust default occlusion settings in the Plugin Project Settings.
2. You can override defaul occlusion settings using the USoftwareOcclusionCullingOverride actor component.
3. You can debug bounds using `r.SoftwareOcclusionCulling.VisualizeBounds 1`
